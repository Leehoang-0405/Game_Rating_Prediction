# Play Quest Conquer (PQC) Game Rating Analysis

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to analyze factors influencing game ratings for Play Quest Conquer (PQC), an online gaming platform headquartered in Sydney, Australia. By applying supervised machine learning techniques using Python, we aim to extract valuable insights from the provided dataset, estimate game ratings, and identify strategies for enhancing user satisfaction and game acquisition.


## Case Study
PQC offers a diverse collection of online games for a monthly subscription fee, allowing users to browse, select, and pay for games. Users can mark games as 'Interest' or 'High Interest' to express their desire to be invited to play. The dataset provided includes various metrics, including `Average_Ratings`, which are crucial for our analysis.

### Objectives
1. **Extract Insights:**
   - General information and configuration of games.
   - Summarization of average playtime and identification of outliers.
   - Analysis of relationships between playtime and average ratings.
   - Examination of complexity levels in relation to ratings.
   - Correlation analysis of game configuration, popularity, and interest with ratings.

2. **Estimation of Game Ratings:**
   - Utilize supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate game ratings based on the dataset.

3. **Strategic Recommendations:**
   - Identify opportunities and strategies to improve user satisfaction and enhance game acquisition.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by PQCâ€™s market research team contains various features relevant to the games, including:
- Game types
- Year of release
- Age category
- Player requirements (minimum and maximum)
- User engagement metrics (e.g., playtime, number of owners, interests)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model selection and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
